# Sound and Script
The first task we want to begin when learning any language is of identifying which sounds are in that langauge, and how the people who use that language represent those sounds. There are some linguistic terms that we can use to decribe these ideas when talking about these concepts generally, and I'll define them loosely as we go. It is incredibly important that we start here, and do not skip this step by using romanization or other workarounds. While they seem to help a student get a headstart on grammar and vocabulary, this invariably sets the student much further back.
