# Plan
To start with, I want to get the general ideas written down and organized. Once I've finished a toki pona course, I'll work on an introduction to Japanese course. Only once that's done will I look at making this into an app.
## toki pona course
toki pona is a very small langauge, so I think I'll be able to create a very small course that could get someone to a decent amount of profeciency in the language fairly quickly. This is going to serve a few purposes, the first of which being establishing how I'll format these courses in general, as well as create a lingua franca that isn't English for my first translation of these courses. 
### Steady Flow
One of the concepts I want to try is a steady flow into the target language. Having the first few lessons being in the known language and then intermediate courses being somewhere in between the two, and the final part of the course being common accross all versions and entirely in the target language.
### Native Explanation
Another important idea I want to explore is that of using native understandings of parts of speech and gramattical rules. No more using the term "conjugate" to describe agglutenation, or calling nouns adjectives merely because of their corresponding english counterparts status as an adjective. By using the terms that the target language native speakers use to teach their own, the learner will have a much more intuitive understanding of the way that natives use the language themselves.
## Japanese Course
If I can accomplish the creation of this toki pona course in a manner that is useful to others, I'll follow up with an introduction to Japanese. Theres the idea of creating graded readers as well, but that's a subject for the other half of this repository.
### To be determined
I shouldn't get to deep into making a Japanese course before finishing the toki pona course, OR before getting certified via either the ATA or the JLPT.
