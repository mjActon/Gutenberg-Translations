# subetego（全て語）
a repository of works in the public domain and my own translations.

## Scope
This is the basis for two specific projects of mine:
1. Establishing my compentence as a Translator in various languages
2. Creation of a method by which to improve my abilities in Language instruction

## To Faithfully Transmit
In the appropriate filepath, I will divide English works into smaller pieces to translate them piece by piece. I'll also maintain a log of my thoughts while translating, and a collection of relevant notes such as character lists to keep my use of proper nouns consistent. These will eventually be combined into whole works, which will then be type-set and put into a easier to read form. I may eventually include footnotes, and I do intend to include study questions. Once a work is completed, I'll publish the book and post it on Amazon. I intend to eventually translate these works to and from the following languages:
- English
- Japanese
- Classical Chinese
- Cantonese
- Mandarin
- Korean
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Hebrew
- toki pona

### English
To begin with, I will be translating from English into Japanese and vice versa primarily. I'll be seeking certification for my translations from the ATA before publishing.

### Japanese
At some point, I would like to create an English course specifically for Japanese speakers. I'd also like to prove myself via ATA certification and by taking and passing the JLPT-N3 exam. To prepare for these tasks, I'll be translating public domain works into Japanese and getting them certified, and then I will post evidence of their certification here.

### toki pona
This is a constructed language made by Sonja Lang that contains less than 150 words. I believe that the task of learning this very small language can inform a learner of the best strategies to go about learning any other language, and I'll elaborate on that later in this document. I intend to translate public domain works into toki pona for use by new and experianced users of the language in practice and general enjoyment.

## To Teach a Tongue
I believe one of the struggles the English speaking world has with learning foreign languages is the excessive amount of English in their courses. I'll give a few examples here and then go into detail in a section specific to this.

### The Status-Quo
Most American adults who took a language course in highschool have little to no retention of the language, with some individuals feeling as though they never had competence in the language to start with. Self study and college have become some of the only places where native speakers of English learn a second language at all, with a lucky few finding opportunities for immersion among friends or family. My intent is to go about the language instruction process in what may be a fundementally different way to the public school system's method.

### Getting to the Root
The central conceptual shift is a focus on the native understanding of concepts. For example: In Japanese, "adjectives" come in two forms, namely い and な adjectives. This complication stems from the english conception of adjectives as a specific kind of word. While Japanese has a kind of word that could be called adjectives (this would be the afformentioned い adjectives), the words that english textbooks call な adjectives are, to the Japanese, merely nouns that happen to be used descriptively, with the な part of the word actually being the particle form of the copula (だ, Japanese's method of creating an "A is B(AがBだ)" sentence). This confusion leads to students being sidelined by native speakers using these words in completely natural ways that pay no mind to English's insistence that these nouns aren't nouns. Similar phenomena are found in studies of Arabic and Hebrew, as well as many other languages.

#Thank you
Thank you for interest in my projects here. Please let me know if you have any ideas you'd like to explore with me, or if you'd like me to instruct you using my experimental language instruction method. Feel free to look at anything here, it's free for a reason; I do claim all rights relavent to my translations. If you'd like to include excerpts in your educational work, please let me know for a few reasons, including the following: I would like credit, and I would like to ensure that you're using a certified translation.
